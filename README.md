# Space Invaders
Space invaders is an interactive web-based game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Itâ€™s a single-player arcade-style game where the player controls a spaceship that moves horizontally between boundaries to shoot at descending alien invaders. The goal is to eliminate the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen.

A re-imagining of the original 1978 arcade game of the same name by Tomohiro Nishikado released by the Taito corporation.
